This repository hosts a complete workshop on Spring Boot + Spring WebFlux.
Just follow this README and create your first WebFlux applications!
Each step of this workshop has its companion commit in the git history with a detailed commit message.

We'll create two applications:

* `stock-quotes` is a functional WebFlux app which streams stock quotes
* `trading-service` is an annotation-based WebFlux app using a datastore, HTML views, and several browser-related technologies

Reference documentations can be useful while working on those apps:

* http://projectreactor.io/docs[Reactor Core documentation]
* Spring WebFlux 
{spring-framework-doc-base}/spring-framework-reference/web-reactive.html#spring-webflux[reference documentation]
and {spring-framework-doc-base}/javadoc-api/[javadoc]


== Stock Quotes application

=== Create this application

Go to `https://start.spring.io` and create a Maven project with Spring Boot {spring-boot-version},
with groupId `io.spring.workshop` and artifactId `stock-quotes`. Select the `Reactive Web`
Boot starter.
Unzip the given file into a directory and import that application into your IDE.

If generated right, you should have a main `Application` class that looks like this:

[source,java]
.stock-quotes/src/main/java/io/spring/workshop/stockquotes/StockQuotesApplication.java
----
include::../stock-quotes/src/main/java/io/spring/workshop/stockquotes/StockQuotesApplication.java[]
----

Edit your `application.properties` file to start the server on a specific port.

[source,properties]
.stock-quotes/src/main/resources/application.properties
----
include::../stock-quotes/src/main/resources/application.properties[]
----

Launching it from your IDE or with `mvn spring-boot:run` should start a Netty server on port 8081.
You should see in the logs something like:

[source,bash]
----
INFO 2208 --- [  restartedMain] o.s.b.web.embedded.netty.NettyWebServer  : Netty started on port(s): 8081
INFO 2208 --- [  restartedMain] i.s.w.s.StockQuotesApplication           : Started StockQuotesApplication in 1.905 seconds (JVM running for 3.075)
----

=== Create a Quote Generator

To simulate real stock values, we'll create a generator that emits such values at a specific interval.
Copy the following classes to your project.

[source,java]
.stock-quotes/src/main/java/io/spring/workshop/stockquotes/Quote.java
----
include::../stock-quotes/src/main/java/io/spring/workshop/stockquotes/Quote.java[]
----

[source,java]
.stock-quotes/src/main/java/io/spring/workshop/stockquotes/QuoteGenerator.java
----
include::../stock-quotes/src/main/java/io/spring/workshop/stockquotes/QuoteGenerator.java[]
----


=== Functional web applications with "WebFlux.fn"

Spring WebFlux comes in two flavors of web applications: annotation based and functional.
For this first application, we'll use the functional variant.

Incoming HTTP requests are handled by a `HandlerFunction`, which is essentially a function
that takes a ServerRequest and returns a `Mono<ServerResponse>`. The annotation counterpart
to a handler function would be a Controller method.

But how those incoming requests are routed to the right handler?

We're using a `RouterFunction`, which is a function that takes a `ServerRequest`, and returns
a `Mono<HandlerFunction>`. If a request matches a particular route, a handler function is returned;
otherwise it returns an empty `Mono`. The `RouterFunction` has a similar purpose as the `@RequestMapping`
annotation in `@Controller` classes.

Take a look at the code samples in 
{spring-framework-doc-base}/spring-framework-reference/web.html#web-reactive-server-functional[the Spring WebFlux.fn reference documentation]

=== Create your first HandlerFunction + RouterFunction

First, create a `QuoteHandler` class and mark it as a `@Component`;this class will have all our handler functions as methods.
Now create a `hello` handler function in that class that always returns "text/plain" HTTP responses with "Hello Spring!" as body.

To route requests to that handler, you need to expose a `RouterFunction` to Spring Boot.
Create a `QuoteRouter` configuration class (i.e. annotated with `@Configuration`) 
that creates a bean of type `RouterFunction<ServerResponse>`.

Modify that class so that GET requests to `"/hello"` are routed to the handler you just implemented.

TIP: Since `QuoteHandler` is a component, you can inject it in `@Bean` methods as a method parameter.

Your application should now behave like this:
[source,bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8081/hello -i
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
transfer-encoding: chunked
Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8

Hello Spring!%
----

Once done, add another endpoint:

* with a HandlerFunction `echo` that echoes the request body in the response, as "text/plain"
* and an additional route in our existing `RouterFunction` that accepts POST requests on
`"/echo"` with a "text/plain" body and returns responses with the same content type.

You can also use this new endpoint with:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8081/echo -i -d "WebFlux workshop" -H "Content-Type: text/plain"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
transfer-encoding: chunked
Content-Type: text/plain

WebFlux workshop%
----


=== Expose the Flux<Quotes> as a web service

First, let's inject our `QuoteGenerator` instance in our `QuoteHandler`, instantiate
a `Flux<Quote>` from it that emits a `Quote` every 200 msec and can be **shared** between
multiple subscribers (look at the `Flux` operators for that). This instance should be kept
as an attribute for reusability.

Now create a `streamQuotes` handler that streams those generated quotes 
with the `"application/stream+json"` content type. Add the corresponding part in the `RouterFunction`,
on the `"/quotes"` endpoint.

[source,bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8081/quotes -i -H "Accept: application/stream+json"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
transfer-encoding: chunked
Content-Type: application/stream+json

{"ticker":"CTXS","price":84.0,"instant":1494841666.633000000}
{"ticker":"DELL","price":67.1,"instant":1494841666.834000000}
{"ticker":"GOOG","price":869,"instant":1494841667.034000000}
{"ticker":"MSFT","price":66.5,"instant":1494841667.231000000}
{"ticker":"ORCL","price":46.13,"instant":1494841667.433000000}
{"ticker":"RHT","price":86.9,"instant":1494841667.634000000}
{"ticker":"VMW","price":93.7,"instant":1494841667.833000000}
----


Let's now create a variant of that â€” instead of streaming all values (with an infinite stream), we can
now take the last "n" elements of that `Flux` and return those as a collection of Quotes with
the content type `"application/json"`. Note that you should take the requested number of Quotes
from the request itself, with the query parameter named `"size"` (or pick `10` as the default size
if none was provided).

[source,bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8081/quotes -i -H "Accept: application/json"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
transfer-encoding: chunked
Content-Type: application/json

[{"ticker":"CTXS","price":85.8,"instant":1494842241.716000000},{"ticker":"DELL","price":64.69,"instant":1494842241.913000000},{"ticker":"GOOG","price":856.5,"instant":1494842242.112000000},{"ticker":"MSFT","price":68.2,"instant":1494842242.317000000},{"ticker":"ORCL","price":47.4,"instant":1494842242.513000000},{"ticker":"RHT","price":85.6,"instant":1494842242.716000000},{"ticker":"VMW","price":96.1,"instant":1494842242.914000000},{"ticker":"CTXS","price":85.5,"instant":1494842243.116000000},{"ticker":"DELL","price":64.88,"instant":1494842243.316000000},{"ticker":"GOOG","price":889,"instant":1494842243.517000000}]%

=== Integration tests with WebTestClient

Spring WebFlux (actually the `spring-test` module) includes a `WebTestClient`
that can be used to test WebFlux server endpoints with or without a running server.
Tests without a running server are comparable to MockMvc from Spring MVC where mock request 
and response are used instead of connecting over the network using a socket.
The WebTestClient however can also perform tests against a running server.

You can check that your last endpoint is working properly with the following
integration test:

[source,java]
.stock-quotes/src/test/java/io/spring/workshop/stockquotes/StockQuotesApplicationTests.java
----
include::../stock-quotes/src/test/java/io/spring/workshop/stockquotes/StockQuotesApplicationTests.java[]
----

== Trading Service application

=== Create this application

Go to `https://start.spring.io` and create a Maven project with Spring Boot {spring-boot-version},
with groupId `io.spring.workshop` and artifactId `trading-service`. Select the `Reactive Web`
, `Devtools`, `Thymeleaf` and `Reactive Mongo` Boot starters.
Unzip the given file into a directory and import that application into your IDE.

=== Use Tomcat as a web engine

By default, `spring-boot-starter-webflux` transitively brings `spring-boot-starter-reactor-netty`
and Spring Boot auto-configures Reactor Netty as a web server. For this application, we'll use
Tomcat as an alternative.

[source,xml]
.trading-service/pom.xml
----
include::../trading-service/pom.xml[tags=tomcat]
----

Note that Spring Boot supports as well Undertow and Jetty.

=== Use a reactive datastore

In this application, we'll use a MongoDB datastore with its reactive driver;
for this workshop, we'll use an in-memory instance of MongoDB. So add the following:

[source,xml]
.trading-service/pom.xml
----
include::../trading-service/pom.xml[tags=inMemMongo]
----

We'd like to manage `TradingUser` with our datastore.

[source,java]
.trading-service/src/main/java/io/spring/workshop/tradingservice/TradingUser.java
----
include::../trading-service/src/main/java/io/spring/workshop/tradingservice/TradingUser.java[]
----

Now create a `TradingUserRepository` interface that extends `ReactiveMongoRepository`.
Add a `findByUserName(String userName)` method that returns a single `TradingUser` in a reactive fashion.

We'd like to insert users in our datastore when the application starts up. For that, create a `UsersCommandLineRunner`
component that implements Spring Boot's `CommandLineRunner`. In the `run` method, use the reactive repository
to insert `TradingUser` instances in the datastore.

NOTE: Since the `run` method returns void, it expects a blocking implementation. This is why you should use the
`blockLast(Duration)` operator on the `Flux` returned by the repository when inserting data.
You can also `then().block(Duration)` to turn that `Flux` into a `Mono<Void>` that waits for completion.

=== Create a JSON web service

We're now going to expose `TradingUser` through a Controller.
First, create a `UserController` annotated with `@RestController`.
Then add two new Controller methods in order to handle:

* GET requests to  `"/users"`, returning all `TradingUser` instances, serializing them with content-type `"application/json"`
* GET requests to  `"/users/{username}"`, returning a single `TradingUser` instance, serializing it with content-type `"application/json"`

You can now validate your implementation with the following test:

[source,java]
.trading-service/src/test/java/io/spring/workshop/tradingservice/UserControllerTests.java
----
include::../trading-service/src/test/java/io/spring/workshop/tradingservice/UserControllerTests.java[]
----

=== Use Thymeleaf to render HTML views

We already added the Thymeleaf Boot starter when we created our trading application.

First, let's add a couple of WebJar dependencies to get static resources for our application:

[source,xml]
.trading-service/pom.xml
----
include::../trading-service/pom.xml[tags=webjars]
----

We can now create HTML templates in our `src/main/resources/templates` folder and map them using controllers.

[source,html]
.trading-service/src/main/resources/templates/index.html
----
include::../trading-service/src/main/resources/templates/index.html[]
----

As you can see in that template, we loop over the `"users"` attribute and write a row in our HTML table for each.

Let's display those users in our application:

* Create a `HomeController` Controller
* Add a Controller method that handles GET requests to `"/"`
* Inject the Spring `Model` on that method and add a `"users"` attribute to it

NOTE: Spring WebFlux will resolve automatically `Publisher` instances before rendering the view,
there's no need to involve blocking code at all!

=== Use the WebClient to stream JSON to the browser

In this section, we'll call our remote `stock-quotes` service to get Quotes from it, so we first need to:

* copy over the `Quote` class to this application
* add the following template file to your application:

[source,html]
.trading-service/src/main/resources/templates/quotes.html
----
include::../trading-service/src/main/resources/templates/quotes.html[]
----

As you can see in this template file, loading that HTML page will cause the browser to send a request
the server for `Quotes` using the Server Sent Event transport.

Now create a `QuotesController` annotated with `@Controller` and add two methods.
One that renders the `quotes.html` template for incoming `"GET /quotes"` requests.
The other should response to `"GET /quotes/feed"` requests with the `"text/event-stream"` content-type,
with a `Flux<Quote>` as the response body. This data is already server by the `stock-quotes` application
, so you can use a `WebClient` to request the remote web service to retrieve that `Flux`.

TIP: You should avoid making a request to the `stock-quotes` service for every browser connecting to
that page â€” for that, you can use the `Flux.share()` operator. 

=== Create and Configure a WebSocketHandler

WebFlux includes functional reactive WebSocket client and server support.

On the server side there are two main components: `WebSocketHandlerAdapter` will handle the incoming
requests by delegating to the configured `WebSocketService` and `WebSocketHandler` will be responsible
to handle WebSocket session.

Take a look at the code samples in 
{spring-framework-doc-base}/spring-framework-reference/web.html#web-reactive-websocket-support[Reactive WebSocket Support documentation]

First, create an `EchoWebSocketHandler` class; it has to implement `WebSocketHandler`.
Now implement `handle(WebSocketSession session)` method. The handler echoes the incoming messages with a delay of 1s.

To route requests to that handler, you need to map the above WebSocket handler to a specific URL: here, `"/websocket/echo"`.
Create a `WebSocketRouter` configuration class (i.e. annotated with `@Configuration`) that creates a bean of type `HandlerMapping`.
Create one additional bean of type `WebSocketHandlerAdapter` which will delegate the processing of
the incoming request to the default `WebSocketService` which is `HandshakeWebSocketService`.

Now create a `WebSocketController` annotated with @Controller and add a method that renders the
`websocket.html` template for incoming `"GET /websocket"` requests.

Add the following template file to your application:

[source,html]
.trading-service/src/main/resources/templates/websocket.html
----
include::../trading-service/src/main/resources/templates/websocket.html[]
----

=== Integration tests with WebSocketClient

`WebSocketClient` included in Spring WebFlux can be used to test your WebSocket endpoints.

You can check that your WebSocket endpoint, created in the previous section, is working properly with the 
following integration test:

[source,java]
.trading-service/src/test/java/io/spring/workshop/tradingservice/websocket/EchoWebSocketHandlerTests.java
----
include::../trading-service/src/test/java/io/spring/workshop/tradingservice/websocket/EchoWebSocketHandlerTests.java[]
----
